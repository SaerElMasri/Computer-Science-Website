                <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>
                <p>
                    Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, 
                    computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application. <br>
                    <br>
                    Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, 
                    database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, 
                    bioinformatics and theory of computing. <br>
                    <br>
                    Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. 
                    Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. 
                    The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers 
                    and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, 
                    that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.

                <h1>What Skills do Computer Scientists Need?</h1>
                <p>
                    Learning how to program and code is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design, 
                    develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, 
                    industry, scientific, and social contexts. And because computers solve problems to serve and enrich 
                    people, there is a significant human component to computer science. Due to the range and complexity 
                    of the projects they take on, computer scientists depend on both technical knowledge and essential 
                    skills like communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Other useful skills include:

                    <li>Analytical and logical thinking </li>
                    <li>Technical and mathematical skills</li>
                    <li>Attention to detail</li>
                    <li>Project management</li>
                    <li>Technical writing</li>
                    <li>Research</li>

                <h1>Fields in Computer Science</h1>
                <p>
                    The sheer number of computer science fields can be staggering and attempting to narrow down the best 
                    field in computer science can be an adventure! It would be impossible to cover them all but let’s consider a 
                    few of the more well-known and popular ones. 
                </p>
                <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>The term artificial intelligence (AI) may conjure up images of those corny movies where robots take 
                    over the world but the truth is that computer scientists are creating sophisticated computers that 
                    are capable of remarkable tasks. More and more our lives are shared with AI that performs tasks like 
                    choosing music for us, processing our spoken and written languages, and completing simple and complex tasks.

                </div>
                <h2>2. Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
                <p>This is one of the fields in computer science that seeks to create better programs by studying how data structures
                     and algorithms interact. The location where data is organized and stored is called a data structure and an algorithm
                      is a specific set of tasks you ask the computer to undertake. 
                </p>

                <h2>3. Game Design</h2>
                <p>We’ve come a long way from video games like Pong, Pac-Man, and Donkey Kong. 
                    What once seemed exciting and cutting edge now pales in comparison to today’s 
                    games that utilize advanced AI, seem astonishingly real, and can be played in real-time against people around the globe. 
                    Game designers utilize AI and machine learning that predicts how players advance, or not, through the game.

                <h1>What is the Future of Computer Science?</h1>
                <p>
                    The fact that technology is indispensable in human life supports its development. 
                    Nowadays, there is almost no sector left, which is not affected by technological devices, especially 
                    computers and smart 2 phones. The internet has introduced many concepts such as online education, 
                    virtual commerce, e-mail, social media platforms, and virtual news sources to humankind. 
                    When there is such a demand for technology and its implications, sub-branches of computer science have become popular fields
