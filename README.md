# Computer-Science-Website

Hello to you! Hope you read my article jeje!
Well, I made this article to give you a small and brief introduction to this huge field. Hopefully I was helpful for you to get info of what Computer Scienciest do and what field you can  later on take!

**How did I build this small article?**

It was simple! By just using basic knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS**. Just with that, you can get a super basic frontend page design without anything fancy!

**How can you start your journey?**

I shared a couple of links to useful webapps where you can learn all you need over there. That's how I did! I was able to built this website using noob knowledge gained by following the course from **FreeCodeCamp**. Also, **The Odin Project** is another super helpful webapp, where I gained the basic of git/github to be able to show you my code and this README file jeje.
Following the content from these webapps will help you start your journey and be one more into this coding life style!

The links for those webapps are:
* [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org) -- This is the website
* [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) -- This is the Youtube Channel
* [Codeacademy] (https://www.codecademy.com)
* [TheOdinProject] (https://www.theodinproject.com)
